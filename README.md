# Howdy! ðŸ¤ 
I'm a purveyor of pixels, writer of news, reader of books, roller of rock, and I'm just the right height to be a Stormtrooper.

I make data-driven graphics and sites at [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/sawyer-click). I focus on narrative-driven data visualizations and small-scale web applications. I'm a [journalist first](https://medium.com/@matthew_daniels/the-journalist-engineer-c9c1a72b993f) and an engineer second.

**ðŸ“® [Let's chat](mailto:sawyer@hey.com)** journalism, data viz, early career advice, goth music, the significance of patricide in ancient Rome!
